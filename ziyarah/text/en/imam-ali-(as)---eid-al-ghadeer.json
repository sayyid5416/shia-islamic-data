        "and upon His favorite angels",

        "the friend of the Lord of the worlds,",
        "and my master as well as the master of all of the believers.",
        "May Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you, too.",
        "Peace be upon you, O my master, O Commander of the Faithful,",

        "about whom they differ",
        "and they shall be asked.",
        "Peace be upon you, O Commander of the Faithful.",
        "You believed in Allah while they were polytheists,",
        "accepted the truth while they belied it,",
        "strove for the sake of Allah while they refrained,",
        "and worshipped Allah with full sincerity to Him in obedience",
        "while you were steadfast, depending upon Him totally, until death came upon you.",
        "Verily, curse of Allah be upon the wrongdoers.",
        "Peace be upon you, O chief of the Muslims,",
        "head of the believers,",
        "guide of the pious ones,",
        "and leader of the white-forehead ones.",
        "Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you.",
        "I bear witness that you are indeed the brother of Allah’s Messenger,",
        "the successor of him, the heir of his knowledge,",
        "his trustee on his laws,",
        "his representative in his nation,",
        "and the first to believe in Allah",
        "and to accept as true all that which was revealed to Allah’s Prophet.",
        "I also bear witness that he (i.e. the Prophet) conveyed all that which Allah revealed to him concerning you;",
        "so, he expounded openly what he was commanded (to expound),",
        "declared to his nation the duty of obedience and loyalty to you,",
        "ordered them to swear allegiance to you,",
        "and declared you as enjoying more priority on the believers than that which they enjoy on themselves",
        "in the same was as Allah has made him enjoy the same.",
        "He then asked Allah the All-exalted to be the witness on them (in this respect),",
        "saying, “Have I conveyed?”",
        "They answered, “Yes, you have. We swear to it by Allah.”",
        "He thus said, “O Allah, be the witness",
        "and You are sufficient Witness and Judge between the servants (0f Yours).”",
        "Hence, curse of Allah be upon him who denied the allegiance to you after he had confessed of it",
        "and upon him who breached his pledge to you after he had taken it.",
        "I also bear witness that you have indeed observed your pledge to Almighty Allah",
        "and that Almighty Allah, in return, shall observe His pledge to you.",
        "“Therefore, whoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah, He will grant him a mighty reward.”",
        "I also bear witness that you are truly the commander of the faithful,",
        "the Divine Revelation did declare your commissioned leadership,",
        "and the Messenger made a covenant with the people (that they would be under your leadership).",
        "I also bear witness that you, along with your uncle and brother,",
        "traded with Allah in your souls;",
        "He therefore revealed about you this:",
        "“Surely, Allah has bought of the believers their persons and their property for this,",
        "that they shall have Paradise;",
        "they fight in Allah's way, so they slay and are slain;",
        "a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Bible and the Qur'an;",
        "and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah?",
        "Rejoice therefore in the pledge which you have made;",
        "and that is the mighty achievement.",
        "They who turn to Allah, who serve Him,",
        "who praise Him, who fast,",
        "who bow down, who prostrate themselves,",
        "who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil,",
        "and who keep the limits of Allah; and give good news to the believers.”",
        "O Commander of the Faithful, I bear witness",
        "that whoever doubts about you has never believed in the Trusted Messenger,",
        "and whoever leaves you to choose another (as his leader) has indeed diverted the true religion,",
        "that the Lord of the worlds has chosen for us,",
        "and that He completed it on the Ghadir Day through (declaring) the Divinely commissioned leadership of you.",
        "And I bear witness that you are the one intended in the following saying of the Almighty, All-merciful Lord:",
        "“And this is My path, the right one; therefore, follow it,",
        "and follow not other ways, for they will lead you away from His way.”",
        "I swear by Allah that whoever follows any one other than you has in fact strayed off the right way and misled others (i.e. those who imitate him),",
        "and that whoever incurs the hostility of you has undoubtedly rejected the right.",
        "O Allah, we have listened to Your command",
        "obeyed, and followed Your straight path;",
        "therefore, (please do) guide us, O our Lord!",
        "And do not cause our hearts to deviate after You have guided us to the obedience to You,",
        "and include us with those who always thank You for Your bounties.",
        "And I also bear witness that you have always been at variance with whimsical desires",
        "as you have always been in line with piety,",
        "you have always been capable of suppressing your rage,",
        "you have always forgiven and pardoned people,",
        "and when Allah is disobeyed, you have always been furious,",
        "and when He is obeyed, you have always been pleased,",
        "and you have always carried out what Allah has commissioned you to do,",
        "you have always observed what has been entrusted with you,",
        "you have always kept what has been confided to you,",
        "you have always conveyed what you were ordered to convey,",
        "and you have always expected that which you were promised.",
        "And I bear witness that as you sometimes conceded some things, you did not do that on account of humiliation,",
        "and as you sometimes did not demand with your right, you did not do that on account of fear,",
        "and as you sometimes stopped combating those who usurped your right, you did not do so on account of weakness,",
        "and as you (on a certain occasion) showed contentment to things to which Allah is not pleased, you did not do so on account of flattery,",
        "and you have never been weakened by what befell you for the sake of Allah,",
        "and you have never been feeble and you have never abased yourself as regards demanding with your rights on account of fear.",
        "I seek Allah’s refuge against such claims;",
        "rather, when you were wronged, you relied upon your Lord in these questions",
        "and entrusted your affair to Him,",
        "and as you reminded them (of their allegiance to you), they did not regard it,",
        "and as you preached them, they did not accept from you,",
        "and as you instructed them to fear Allah, they did not mind.",
        "I also bear witness, O Commander of the Faithful,",
        "that you strove in the way of Allah in the most appropriate way",
        "until Allah summoned you to be in His vicinity,",
        "chose to grasp you,",
        "and established the argument against your enemies who killed you,",
        "so that you should have argument against them,",
        "although you enjoy conclusive arguments against all of His creatures.",
        "Peace be upon you, O Commander of the Faithful.",
        "You have worshipped Allah sincerely,",
        "striven in the way of Allah steadfastly,",
        "sacrificed yourself, seeking Allah’s judgment,",
        "acted upon His Book,",
        "followed His Prophet’s instructions,",
        "performed the prayers,",
        "paid the zakat,",
        "enjoined what is right,",
        "and forbidden what is wrong as much as you could,",
        "seeking what is possessed by Allah",
        "and desiring for that which Allah has promised.",
        "You have never cared for misfortunes,",
        "never yielded to the hardships,",
        "and never stopped fighting against any warrior on account of fear.",
        "Indeed, whoever claims anything opposite to this to you is actually fabricating",
        "and is forging lies to you,",
        "and whoever leaves your path is drawing himself near to destruction.",
        "You have certainly striven in the way of Allah as exactly as required,",
        "stood harm for the sake of Allah,",
        "have been the foremost to believe in Allah,",
        "the first to offer prayer and to strive,",
        "and the first to expose himself in the land of the polytheists,",
        "while the lands were suffocated with deviation,",
        "Satan was worshipped openly,",
        "and (in the midst of this) you said, “The big number of people that surround me shall never increase my might,",
        "nor shall their departing me make me feel lonely.",
        "I thus shall never submit even if all peoples desert me.”",
        "Because you resorted to Allah, you were the mightiest,",
        "and because you preferred the Next World to this worldly life, you have been ascetic.",
        "Thus, Allah supported, guided,",
        "chose, and selected you.",
        "Your deeds were never contradictory,",
        "your words were never paradoxical,",
        "your situations were never fickle,",
        "you have never claimed falsely or forged lies against Allah,",
        "you have never been greedy for the wreckage of this world,",
        "you have never been defiled by sins,",
        "you have always had manifest proof from your Lord,",
        "and you have always been certain of what you do,",
        "as you used to guide to the right and to a straight path.",
        "I bear true witness",
        "and I truly swear by Allah",
        "that Muhammad and his Household—may Allah’s blessings be upon them—are the masters of all creatures",
        "and you are indeed my master and the master of all believers,",
        "the servant and friend of Allah,",
        "the brother, successor, and heir of the Messenger,",
        "who used to say to you,",
        "“I swear this by Him Who sent me with the truth: whoever denies you has never believed in me,",
        "whoever rejects you has never confessed of Allah’s existence,",
        "whoever abandons you has actually strayed off,",
        "and whoever is not guided be you has never found the way to Allah or to me.",
        "Confirming this, my Lord the the Almighty and All-majestic says,",
        "‘Most surely, I am most Forgiving to him who repents and believes and does good,",
        "then follows the right path.’ To follow the right path is to adhere to your Divinely commissioned leadership.”",
        "O master, your favor cannot be concealed",
        "and your light cannot be extinguished.",
        "Verily, he who rejects you shall be the most misfortunate wrongdoer.",
        "O master, you are the (Divine) claim against the servants,",
        "the guiding to uprightness,",
        "and our means on the Promised Day.",
        "O master, Allah has indeed elevated your standing in this world,",
        "raised your rank in the Hereafter,",
        "and led you to that which has not been seen by those who antagonized you,",
        "those who stood between you and Allah’s gifts to you.",
        "So, curse of Allah be upon those who violated your sanctity",
        "and those who prevented you from taking your right.",
        "I do bear witness that these are the biggest losers",
        "whose faces shall be scorched by Hellfire",
        "and they therein shall be in severe affliction.",
        "And I bear witness that whenever you did something or you avoided doing something,",
        "and whenever you said something or you kept silent;",
        "all these were by the order of Allah and His Messenger.",
        "You thus said, “I swear this by Him Who grasps my soul:",
        "when the Messenger of Allah—peace of Allah be upon him and his Household—",
        "watched me striking (the enemies) with my sword ceaselessly, he said to me,",
        "‘O `Ali, your position to me is the same as (Prophet) Aaron’s position to (Prophet) Moses;",

        "I would like to further inform you that your death and your lifestyle shall be with me and according to my instruction.’",
        "(Imam `Ali continued,) I swear by Allah that I have not told untruth and none shall belie me,",
        "and I have never strayed off and none shall ever mislead me,",
        "and I have never forgotten my Lord’s instructions to me,",
        "and I do follow the true path of my Lord that He showed His Prophet",
        "and the Prophet showed me,",
        "and, most certainly, I am following the lucid path step by step.”",
        "By Allah I swear, true are your words and you have said nothing but the truth.",
        "Curse of Allah be upon those who compare you to your enemies,",
        "while Allah, Whose Name be elevated, says,",
        "“Are those who know and those who do not know alike?”",
        "So, the curse of Allah be upon those who compared you to those whom Allah has ordered to follow your leadership,",
        "while you are the friend of Allah,",
        "the brother of His Messenger,",
        "the defender of His religion,",
        "and the one whose preference (to all others) has been declared by the Qur'an;",

        "“And Allah shall grant to the strivers above the holders back a mighty reward.",
        "(High) degrees from Him, protection, and mercy.",
        "And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.”",
        "Almighty Allah has also said,",
        "“Do you make one who undertakes the giving of drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred Mosque",

        "Those who believed, fled their homes,",

        "as you have never accepted any alternative for the right guidance",
        "and you have never associated anyone in your worshipping your Lord.",
        "And Almighty Allah has responded the prayer of His Prophet—",
        "peace of Allah be upon him and his Household—concerning you.",
        "He then ordered him to proclaim the position of succeeding him in (the leadership of) his nation,",

        "If you did it not, you would not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission.",

        "Accordingly, he (i.e. the Prophet) burdened himself with the loads of (long) walking",
        "and stood up under the burning sun in the midst of the desert,",
        "where he delivered a speech, made everyone listen to him,",
        "and called upon them with rhetorical language.",

        "and your sagacity in all affairs,",
        "he (i.e. the Prophet) appointed you as the commander on all occasions,",
        "and you were never under the commandment of another.",
        "On many occasions, your piety prevented you from doing what you had decided about a matter,",

        "to be preventing him from orders and prohibitions of Allah,",

        "How deviant from the right he who has wronged you is!",
        "They then deceptively decided the share of ‘Near of Kin’ to be for you,",

        "As you replaced the Prophet by spending that night on his bed instead of him, this situation was similar to the situation of the self-sacrificing Prophet, peace be upon him.",
        "Because you responded (to the Prophet’s order) in the same way as he (i.e. Prophet Isma`il) responded (to his father’s request),",
        "and you obeyed the Prophet in the same way as (Prophet) Isma`il obeyed with steadfastness and reliance upon Allah.",
        "Hence, when his father said to him, ‘O my son! Surely, I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice you;",
        "consider then what you see.’",
        "He said, ‘O my father! Do what you are commanded;",

        "and He, majestic be His mention, declared your excellent deed by saying:",
        "“And among men is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah.”",
        "Then, your ordeal on the Battle of Siffin,",
        "when books of the Qur'an were raised (on spearheads) out of trickery and deception,",
        "causing doubt to be aroused,",
        "the truth to be neglected,",
        "and conjecture to be followed,",
        "this ordeal was similar to the ordeal of (Prophet) Aaron when (Prophet) Moses appointed him as the leader of his people, but they left him alone,",
        "while (Prophet) Aaron was calling at them, saying:",
        "‘O my people! You are only tried by it, and surely your Lord is the Beneficent Allah.",
        "Therefore, follow me and obey my order.’",
        "They said, ‘We will by no means cease to keep to its worship until Moses returns to us.’",
        "Similarly, when the books of the Qur'an were raised (on spearheads), you said:",
        "‘O my people, you are only tried by this and you have been surely cheated.’",
        "Nevertheless, they disobeyed you and did the opposite.",
        "And when they demanded with nominating two arbitrators (one from each party),",
        "you rejected and declared your disavowal of this act before Allah, and then asked them to do whatever they wanted.",
        "Thus, when the truth manifested itself",
        "the wrong was proven as futile,",
        "and they confessed of their flaw and deviation from the right thing,",

        "and you had forbidden it, and they then confessed of the sin that they had committed.",
        "While you were following the course of sagacity and true guidance,",
        "they were following the courses of deviation and blindness.",
        "Nonetheless, they insisted on hypocrisy",
        "and involved themselves in seduction",
        "until Allah made them taste the evil result of their conduct.",
        "He thus deadened, through your sword, those who mutinied against you, causing them eternal misery and perdition,",
        "and He gave life, through your acting as His argument, to those whom He decided as happy; therefore, they were guided (to the true choice).",
        "Allah’s blessings be upon you, coming and going,",
        "and still and moving.",
        "Certainly, no one praising you can ever cover your actual characteristics",
        "and no one criticizing you can ever belittle your merits.",
        "You are verily the best worshipper of all created beings,",
        "the most sincere in asceticism,",
        "and the most enthusiastic defender of the religion.",
        "You executed the laws of Allah with exceptional efforts",
        "and damaged the armies of the apostates with your sword.",
        "You can extinguish the flames of battles with your finger,",
        "tear out the curtains of seditions with your eloquent language,",
        "and distinguish the confusing wrong from the plain right.",
        "You are never influenced by any censure as long as you work for the sake of Allah.",
        "The praising of Allah the All-exalted to you suffices",
        "from the praising of any other one and from the approval of the depicters.",
        "Almighty Allah says:",
        "“Of the believers are men who are true to the covenant which they made with Allah.",
        "So, of them is he who accomplished his vow, of them is he who yet waits, and they have not changed in the least.”",
        "After you felt that you had killed the preachers, the wrongdoers, and the apostates,",
        "the predictions of Allah’s Messenger—peace be upon him and his Household—came true,",
        "and you had fulfilled your promise to him, you then said:",

        "you were acting with sure knowledge of what you do,",
        "you were on your way to Allah,",
        "and you were rejoicing in the bargain that you had made with Him;",
        "and that is the supreme triumph.",
        "O Allah, curse the murderers of your Prophets and the murderers of Your Prophets’ successors",
        "with the variant curses (that You have prepared for them),",
        "and make those slayers to taste the heat of Your fire.",
        "And also curse those who usurped the right of Your friend,",
