As for Shaykh al-Tusi, he says, â€œThis invocation is reported from the Patron of the Age, Imam al-Mahdi, peace be upon him. It was shown to Abu'l-Hasan al-Zarrab in Makkah

ðŸ’  Background

Narrated through a chain by Sayed Ibn Tawoos and Shiekh Tosi may Allah's mercy be upon them through a chain going to Yaqob ibn Yosif AlZarrab AlGassani that in 281 AH on his Haj pilgrimage to MECA from Asfahan along with a group of opposers and some went ahead and rented a room to stay in what was referred to as Dar-e-Khadija also called Dar-e-Rizza (AS). In it was a dark-skinned old lady to whom I had asked who are you? And why is this placed called Dar-Rizza?
I'm a one of their followers and Al Hassan ibn Ali (AS) arranged for me to live in it! As I was his servant!
I was very pleased to hear this and stayed in the place along with my opposing mates and stayed in one room whilst shutting the door using a heavy stone. As we were there, we used to see a glowing man entering the place without the door or stone moving from its place and he used to enter another room to which the old lady did not allow us to go to.
After seeing this I requested the old lady to meet me as I wanted to enquire about the person. She replied by saying that the man advices you to be careful with whom you are dealing with as they mean you harm. I was surprised as indeed I had a quarrel in relation to a debt with my companions. I further enquired and asked the lady about her relationship to Imam Rizza (AS). She explained that she was Imam Hassan's servant and the Imam had told her that she would serve the last Imam AJT.
Someone not so fluent in Arabic had requested me to carry out Hajj on his behalf and paying for my expenses and handing me a letter. I had brought 30 Dinars with me with the intention of placing them in Maqam Ibrahim (AS) but as I was taking to my self-thinking that it's better to hand it to a son of bibi Fatima (the man with the glowing face came to my mind) and handed the amount to the old lady. She came back after a while saying
He says, we have no right over these, do keep them in the place you had intended to do so, yet in return take something in return for this Rizvi lady!
I letter I had with me had the last Imam's signature and was from Al Qasim ibn Alaa from Azerbaijan and I requested the old lady to confirm that its indeed the master's signature.
She went and came back confirm so and giving me good tidings through this Salawat through another letter!Only this time it was from the man with the glowing face with his signature â€¦.the Hujjat (AJT) stating that this is the way Salawat should be recited!

Sayed ibn Tawoos states that this salawat should not be left out for a reason shown to us by Allah (subhan hoo)â€¦

Najmus saaqib pg 1092

This blessed report is mentioned in some other reliable books1; it is narrated from the past scholars through numerous chains of narrators and in some of them in all the places it is mentioned: O Allah, blessâ€¦and so on. And in no report is time fixed for recitation of this supplication, except that Sayyid Raziuddin Ali bin Taaoos in Jamaalul Usboo, Pg. 301 after the mention of effective supplication after the Asr Prayer on Friday has said: If you leave the post prayer litanies of Asr Prayer in Friday due to some excuse, you must never omit these Salawat in any case from the aspect that the Almighty Allah has informed us about it. It can be concluded from this blessed statements that nothing is impossible from his lofty rank; as clarified in the previous chapter that the gate of His Eminence is open.
