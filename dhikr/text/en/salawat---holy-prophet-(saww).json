        "DESC: Recited after Asr on Friday",
        "In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate",
        "O Allah, indeed Muhammad is as You described him in Your Book",
        "Where You say, \"There has come to you a Messenger from among yourselves\"",
        "It grieves him that you should perish; he is deeply concerned for you",
        "To the believers, he is compassionate and merciful",
        "So I bear witness that he is as You described him",
        "And that You did not command prayers upon him,",
        "Except after You and Your angels prayed upon him",
        "And You revealed in Your clear Qur’an, \"Indeed, Allah and His angels\"",
        "Send blessings upon the Prophet",
        "O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allah to grant him] peace",
        "Not out of need for the prayer of any of the creatures,",
        "From the created beings after Your prayer upon him,",
        "Nor to their purifying him after Your purification of him,",
        "Rather, all creatures are in need of that",
        "Because You made him Your door,",
        "From which You do not accept anyone except through him",
        "And You made the prayer upon him a means of drawing near to You,",
        "And a means to You and a closeness in Your presence",
        "And You guided the believers to him and commanded them to pray upon him,",
        "So they may increase in preference with You and honor in Your sight",
        "And You entrusted Your angels with those who pray upon him,",
        "They pray upon him and convey their prayers to him,",
        "And their greetings of peace",
        "O Allah, the Lord of Muhammad, may Allah’s blessings be upon him and his family",
        "Indeed, I ask You by what You have magnified of the matter of Muhammad,",
        "And what You have made obligatory of his right,",
        "That You set my tongue free to pray upon him,",
        "In what You love and are pleased with,",
        "And in what You have not set free the tongue of anyone,",
        "From Your creation, and have not granted him",
        "Then grant me, through that, his companionship,",
        "Where You have placed him in Your sanctity,",
        "And the gardens of Your paradise",
        "Then do not separate me from him",
        "O Allah, I begin with bearing witness to him,",
        "Then with the prayer upon him,",
        "And if I do not reach, through that, the satisfaction of myself,",
        "Nor my tongue expresses what is in my heart,",
        "Nor am I blamed for my shortcoming,",
        "Due to my inability to fulfill what is obligatory upon me,",
        "From him, because it is my portion,",
        "And a right upon me and fulfillment of what You have made obligatory,",
        "To him, as he conveyed Your messages,",
        "Without neglecting what You commanded,",
        "Nor exceeding what You prohibited,",
        "Nor falling short in what You desired,",
        "Nor transgressing what You advised",
        "And he recited Your verses as You revealed them,",
        "To him, Your revelation, and he strived in Your cause,",
        "Advancing, not retreating,",
        "Fulfilling Your covenant and confirming Your promise,",
        "And he proclaimed Your command, not fearing the blame of any critic",
        "And he distanced for Your sake the nearest and brought near for Your sake the farthest",
        "And he commanded with Your obedience and was commanded by it,",
        "In secret and in public",
        "And he forbade Your disobedience and refrained from it",
        "And he guided to good manners and adhered to them,",
        "And he forbade bad manners and abstained from them",
        "And he befriended Your allies with what You love,",
        "To be befriended in word and deed",
        "And he called to Your way with wisdom and good counsel,",
        "And he worshiped You sincerely until certainty came to him,",
        "And You took him to Yourself, pious, pure, and righteous,",
        "Having completed the religion through him and perfected the blessings through him,",
        "And manifested the proofs through him,",
        "And established the laws of Islam through him,",
        "And distinguished the lawful from the unlawful through him,",
        "And guided Your creation through him to Your straight path,",
        "And clarified through him the signs and stars,",
        "By which they are guided",
        "And You did not leave them in blindness after him,",
        "Wandering in confusion, nor in doubt",
        "And You did not leave them to their own views in their religion,",
        "According to their opinions,",
        "Nor their choosing according to their desires,",
        "Lest they be divided into the darkness of innovations,",
        "And be confounded in the overwhelming darkness,",
        "And the paths diverge for them in what they know",
        "And I bear witness that he departed from this world,",
        "Pleased with You, and You pleased with him, praiseworthy",
        "Among the near ones, and Your prophets, the messengers,",
        "And Your righteous chosen servants,",
        "And he is not blameworthy nor disgraceful,",
        "And he was not among those who pretend,",
        "And he was not a magician, nor was he bewitched,",
        "Nor a soothsayer, nor was soothsaying done for him,",
        "Nor a poet, nor was poetry composed for him,",
        "Nor a liar, and indeed he was Your messenger,",
        "And the seal of the prophets,",
        "Who brought the truth from You,",
        "And confirmed the messengers",
        "And I bear witness that those who denied him,",
        "Will taste the painful punishment",
        "And I bear witness that what he brought to us from You,",
        "And informed us about You is the absolute truth,",
        "There is no doubt in it from the Lord of the worlds",
        "O Allah, so bless Muhammad,",
        "Your servant, Your messenger, Your prophet, and Your chosen one,",
        "Your confidant, Your chosen one, Your pure one, and Your elite,",
        "From Your creation, the one You chose for Your messages,",
        "And selected him for Your religion,",
        "And entrusted him with Your servants and Your revelation",
        "The flag of guidance and the gate of wisdom,",

        "To the abode of life and the dwellings of the righteous",
        "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from its vanishing,",
        "And its shaking, and the tyranny of its rulers and authorities,",
        "And the evil of its devil, and the aggression of those who oppress me in it",
        "O Allah, whoever intends me with harm, intend him with harm,",
        "And whoever plots against me, plot against him,",
        "And blind the eyes of the disbelievers,",
        "And protect me from that with tranquility,",
        "And clothe me with Your impenetrable armor,",
        "And place me in Your complete protection,",
        "And rectify my condition and bless me in my family,",
