        "DESC: Imām Muhammad ibn Alī al-Bāqir (as) said: \"On Ashura Day, before noon, he should go to a desert or an elevated portion of his house and recite salutations to Imam Husain (as), curse his killers excessively and pray two Rakats prayers. Then he should mourn and lament over Imam Husain (as), order everyone in his house to lament him, hold a gathering in his house narrating Imam Husain’s tragedies and become restless on the tragedies of the Imam (as), meet one another weeping and consoling one another over the Imam’s tragedies. If they do so, I guarantee that the Almighty Allāh will record all of those rewards for him. [References: Kamiluz Ziyaraat, Chapter 71, Tradition 7, page 162]",
        "DESC: Imām Alī ibn Mūsā al-Rezā (as) said: “Whoever avoids attending to his worldly affairs on the tenth of Muharram, Allāh will fulfill all the wishes and desires of this world as well as the hereafter. Whoever considers this day to be a day of mourning, sorrow and weeping for himself, Allāh the Glorified will make the day of Qiyāmah to be a day of rejoicing for him and his eyes will be cooled in Paradise on account of us.",
        "DESC: And whoever considers the tenth of Muharram to be a day of prosperity and buys something for his house (considering it a good omen), then Allāh will not give him affluence in that thing. And on the day of Qiyāmah he will be made to arise along with Yazid, Ubaydullāh bin Ziyād and Umar ibn Sa'ad (may Allāh's curse be on all of them) and will be thrown into the lowest abyss of hell.”",
