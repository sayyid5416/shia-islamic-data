Then he should mourn and lament over Imam Husain (as), order everyone in his house to lament him, hold a gathering in his house narrating Imam Husain’s tragedies and become restless on the tragedies of the Imam (as), meet one another weeping and consoling one another over the Imam’s tragedies. If they do so, I guarantee that the Almighty Allāh will record all of those rewards for him. [References: Kamiluz Ziyaraat, Chapter 71, Tradition 7, page 162]",
