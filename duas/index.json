And if he happens to die before the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (ajtfs), Allah will raise him up from his grave so that he may assist the holy Imam (ajtfs).\n\nFor every word that he recites in this supplication, Allah will grant him 1000 good deeds and will erase from his scroll of deeds 1000 sins”. As the title suggests, this supplication is of allegiance (ahad) to the holy Imam (ajtfs). Its recitation every morning ensures the renewal of this covenant as taught by Imam Ali ibne Abi Talib (as)",

        "description": "Shaykh Tusi reports in Misbah al-Mutahajjid that Muhammad bin Khalid al-Tayalisi narrated from Sayf bin ‘Umayra who said: “I rode out with Safwan bin Mihran al-Jammal towards al- Ghariy [Najaf], and a group of our companions were with us. This was after Abu ‘Abdillah (a.s.) (i.e. Imam al-Sadiq) had left. Later we set out for Medina from al-Hira. When we had completed performing the pilgrimage rites, Safwan turned his face in the direction of the grave of Abu ‘Abdillah (al-Husayn) (a.s.) and said to us: ‘salute and greet al-Husayn (a.s.) from this place, from the place of the head of the grave of the Prince of the Believers, the blessings of Allah be upon him, for Abu ‘Abdillah (al-Sadiq) (a.s.) pointed towards it (towards the grave of al-Husayn) from right here, and I was with him.’”\n\nHe (Sayf bin 'Umayra) said: “Then Safwan recited the salutation, which ‘Alqama bin Muhammad al-Hadhrami had narrated from Abu Ja‘far al-Baqir (a.s.) for the day of ‘Ashura. Thereafter he recited two units of prayer at the head of the grave of the Prince of the Believers [Imam Ali (a.s.)]. At the end of these two rites, he bid farewell to the Prince of the Believers and gestured towards (the grave of) al-Husayn (a.s.) in the state of salutations and greetings, making his departure while his face was turned towards his (al-Husayn's) direction and bid him farewell. At the end he recited the following supplication: ‘O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O He who responds to the call of the afflicted…’ (The famous supplication, widely known as the supplication of ‘Alqama).”\n\nAt the end of the tradition, Safwan says to Sayf bin ‘Umayra: “I arrived with my Master, Abu ‘Abdillah al-Sadiq (a.s.) at this place and he acted in a similar way to how we acted in our pilgrimage rituals and he supplicated with this supplication when bidding farewell after having recited the ritual prayers which we had recited, and he bade farewell in the same manner as we bade farewell.”",

Imam Ali asked Kumayl to sit down, record and memorise the \"Du'a\" which Imam Ali dictated to Kumayl.\n\nImam Ali then advised Kumayl to recite this \"Du'a\" on the eve of (i.e. evening preceding) every Friday, or once a month or at least once in every year so that, added Imam Ali, \"Allah may protect thee from the evils of the enemies and the plots contrived by impostors.

        "title": "Dua Nudba",
        "description": "Among the most important supplications within our tradition is Dua al-Nudbah. It is an invocation where we pray for the hastening of the return of our twelfth Imam, Imam Mahdi (p), and also eloquently build a spiritual link with him. We are taught through traditions to recite this particular prayer on the four festive holidays, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, Eid al-Ghadeer, and on Fridays.1 This is a beautiful portrayal of what it means to devote ourselves to the Imam of our time during the period of his occultation. Though the Imam is not in our physical company, we have an opportunity to connect with him on a spiritual level and demonstrating our commitment to him by reciting the powerful words of the supplication.\n\nThe Importance of Dua al-Nudbah\nDua al-Nudba, or the “supplication of lamentation” is traditionally recited weekly on the day of Friday. The supplication is narrated by Sayed Ibn Tawus, who was one of the greatest scholars within the school of Ahl al-Bayt (p), in one of his famous works.2 Ibn Mashadi, who is also one of the greatest scholars, narrates it in his famous encyclopedic work of supplications and visitations of the Holy Household.3 It is known as the “supplication of lamentation” because it brings the believers to tears during the course of its recitation, due to the fact that the Imam is in occultation when we are in great need and desire for his presence. From its early onset, upon praising God and sending salutations upon the Prophet Muhammad and his progeny (pbut), we immediately enter into the emotional invocation.\n\nThemes of Dua al-Nudbah\nThere are numerous themes that this invocation emphasizes.\n\n1. God's Wisdom in Choosing Representatives:\nDua al-Nudbah, like many of the other prayers left as a legacy for us by the Holy Household (pbht) begins with a praise of God, and immediately begins to explain God's wisdom in choosing His divine representatives on earth. It is vital to keep in mind that the focal point of this prayer is to connect us with Imam Mahdi (p), and thus the frame of the introduction speaks to God’s chosen guides, the prophets, messengers, and imams. We state, “Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. And blessings of God be upon our Leader Muhammad, His Prophet, and on his progeny. O God! All praise is for You for that which You decided upon and resolved in the matter of Your close servants, whom You chosen for Yourself and Your religion.”4\nWithin a contemporary frame, that guide for us is Imam Mahdi (p), the son of Imam Hassan al-Askari (p).\n\n2. Lamentation Over the Tragedy of the Ahl al-Bayt:\nThe second theme within the dua is the beginning of the lamentation—lamentation for the oppression that the Prophet and his family had to endure so patiently and gracefully. The Imam eloquently speaks to the merit of Imam Ali (p), but also how quickly his station in the early Muslim community was neglected, eventually leading to his martyrdom and that of his blessed sons. We state, “The community [of people who stood against Ahlulbayt] flocked together to cut off [and abandon] His kinship [Ahlulbayt] and excluded his decedents [from their rightful position in succeeding of the Prophet, and leading the Muslims] except a handful of sincere faithful ones [true Shia] who kept their promise and dutifully upheld the rights of his descendants; Some [of Ahl al-Bayt] were slain, some were taken as captives and some were banished, and [divine] decree was set for them [in bearing the greatest calamities] For which they are expected to receive the best reward).” These lines shake our hearts and core, as we move to the next stage of the prayer, where we earnestly call upon the Awaited Savior (p).\n\n3. Calling Upon Imam Mahdi (p):\nAlthough we may not easily see Imam Mahdi (p) during his occultation, it is imperative that we recognize the potential to still form a strong link to him by finding time to speak with him in solitude as we do during the course of Dua al-Nudbah. We call out to the Imam by some of his titles and attributes. We state, “Where is the everlasting legacy of God which the guiding [prophetic] progeny is never vacant of (i.e., there is always a living representative of God from Ahl al-bayt)? Where is the one intended for eliminating the roots of the oppressors? Where is the one awaited for pulling down the foundations of confusion and hypocrisy? Where is the one hoped for removing oppression and aggression? Where is the one spared for reviving the duties and traditions? ”6\nAs numerous traditions demonstrate, with the advent of the Imam, peace and justice will be established, overriding injustice and oppression.\n\n4. Demonstration of Our Desperation for the Awaited Savior (p): When supplicating for the Imam (p), it is important that we seek him in a state of desperation because we have such an intense need to be in his company with all the injustice that surrounds us. We should have a true, sincere desire to be in his blessed company. In this dua, we state, “Oh God] grant us his compassion, mercy, prayer, and his benevolence through which we receive ampleness from Your mercy and victory [in achieving the everlasting happiness in paradise]. [Oh God] And by him [through the intercession of Imam Mahdi (p)], accept our prayers, forgive our sins, fulfill our desires, give us means of livelihood, unrestricted, lessen our hardships, and grant us our desires.”7\nThrough the demonstration of our sincere desire to be in his presence, the aspiration is that God will allow us to be among his helpers and supporters upon the conclusion of his occultation. It is recommended to recite this on Fridays & the 4 Idd days; the Idd ulFitr (1st Shawwal), the Idd al-Azha day (10th of Dhu’l-hijjah), the `Eid al-Ghadir day (18th of Du’l-hijjah).",

If the people knew how fast this prayer is fulfilled, they would rush to learn it.

He told the Prophet to depart with his Trustee, sons, wife and tribe and challenge them by reciting these supplications. Abu Abdullah As-Sadiq (as) said, “Whenever you say these supplications, ask for what is the best near God and what is more eternal. This is one of the treasures of knowledge. Ask God for intercession with it, and hide it from the unwise and the hypocrites.\"",
