        "INFO: The Atmosphere of Yazid’s Court",
        "DESC: The court of Yazid was filled with senior officials, dignitaries of Sham, some ambassadors of foreign governments and religious leaders of other faiths. It was in such a setting that the family of Imam Husayn (as) was brought in as prisoners without any veils or scarfs.",
        "DESC: A herald was constantly announcing in the bazar as well as the imperial court that the head of a dissident is being brought who had rebelled against the caliph. The blessed head of Imam Husayn (as) was presented to Yazid on a silver plate and placed in front of his throne.",
        "DESC: Overcome with his apparent victory, Yazid started poking the blessed head of Imam Husayn (as) with his stick and expressing his joy by reciting the following lines of a blasphemous poetry of ‘Abdullah bin az-Ziba‘ri:",
        "DESC: \"The Hashimites staged a drama for domination, For there was no Divine news nor any revelation. Wish my ancestors killed in Badr would see, The pain of Khazraj caused by pointed spears\"",
        "DESC: Yazid’s display of arrogance and blasphemous words prompted Lady Zaynab to stand up and address him in the court filled with the elite of Sham. The aura of her personality even as a prisoner and the eloquence of her speech were such that Yazid could not do anything to prevent her from speaking!",
        "INFO: Bibi Zaynab’s Sermon",
        "DESC: 💠 The Preamble",
        "All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the universe; and blessings be upon my grandfather, the chief of God’s messengers.",
        "Indeed, Almighty Allah has spoken the truth when He said,",
        "“Then the final state of those who do evil (deeds) was that they denied the signs of Allah and they used to ridicule them.” (30:10)",
        "DESC: First comment: Zaynab puts an emphasis that the Prophet is “my grandfather;” he is from our family, from ‘Ali’s family; and not from your family, O Yazid!",
        "DESC: Second comment: Zaynab’s mastery over the Qur’an become obvious by her selection of verses in this sermon. After praising Allah and asking for blessing upon the Prophet, she recites the first verse that is very befitting for the occasion and is fully applied on Yazid.",
        "DESC: In other words, she is saying that O Yazid, the lines of poetry that you recited demonstrates that those who do evil deeds will eventually deny the Qur’an as a revelation and ridicule it. (The “signs of Allah” could refer to the Qur’an as well as the blessed head of Imam Husayn.)",
        "Do you think, O Yazid, now that you have ‘seized the vastness of the earth from us and constrained the horizons upon us,’11 and that we are being herded like the prisoners—that Allah wishes humiliation for us and honor for you?",
        "And that in this is a great importance for you with Allah? So you are being haughty and looking around exuberantly and happily since you see that the world is in your control and its affairs are lined up for you, and our country is exclusively for you and our government is purely for you.",
        "But hold on and slow down! Have your forgotten Almighty Allah’s words:",
        "“Let the faithless not suppose that the respite that We grant them is good for their souls: We give them respite only that they may increase in sin, and [eventually] there is a humiliating punishment for them.” (3:178)",
        "DESC: Third comment: Lady Zaynab did not address the ruthless ruler by his common titles; rather she addressed him by his name only. This was a slap on his face!",
        "DESC: Fourth comment: Look at the courage of the daughter of “Allah’s lion:” right in the court of Yazid, she describes his rule and government as an usurped power and claims it to be her family’s right.",
        "DESC: Fifth comment: By quoting the verse from Chapter Three, she tells Yazid that he should not considered his apparent victory as a sign of Allah’s pleasure. They may be delay in reprisal but it will eventually come.",
        "DESC: 💠 Exposing Yazid’s Family Background",
        "O the son of the freed slave! Is it just that you cover your women and slave-girls with veils while you parade the daughters of Allah’s Messenger as prisoners?! You have torn their apparel coverings, exposed their faces, and the enemies ushered them on from one city to another. The dwellers of the caravansaries as well as the cities were looking towards them, and the people from near and far as well as the noble and the servants were scrutinizing their faces while they had neither a helper from their menfolk nor a protector from their protectors.",
        "DESC: First comment: “O son of the freed slave!” In the imperial court of Yazid, right in presence of the elite and the government officials of Sham, Zaynab exposes his family background. At the conquest of Mecca in 8 AH, after seeing the strength of the Muslim army, Yazid’s grandfather, Abu Sufyan, and his family converted to Islam.",
        "DESC: If Zaynab’s grandfather, the Prophet of Islam, had wished he could have made the people of Mecca (including Abu Sufyan and his family) as his personal slaves. But the Prophet manifested his benevolence and emancipated the people of Mecca by saying, “…Go, you are free…;”12 in other words, ‘I could have made your my slaves but I let you go as freed slaves.’",
        "DESC: With such an exposure, the people of Sham heard for the first time that Yazid’s grandparents and father embraced Islam in the later years of the Prophet’s life and that they were the Prophet’s freed slaves. Such a revelation must have shattered the aura of “khalu ’l-mu’minin – the uncle of the believers” from the minds of the people of Sham!",
        "DESC: 💠 Exposing Yazid’s Behavioral Background",
        "There is neither anything unusual about you nor any surprise in your actions. How can there be any hope of consideration from child of a person whose mouth spat the liver of the righteous ones and whose flesh grew upon the blood of the martyrs. A person who looks towards us with disdain, rancor, vendetta and secret grudge does not wait long before displaying his hatred towards us, the Ahlul Bayt.",
        "DESC: First Comment: Zaynab now describes the behavioral profile of Yazid: a profile in which she cannot expect any justice because his character is influenced by his grandmother, Hind, a ruthless and immoral person. As a proof to the people of Sham, Zaynab refers to the Battle of Uhud in which Yazid’s grandmother ordered her slave to cut open the abdomen of Hamza (the Prophet’s uncle), from which she took out his liver and tried to chew on it. That is why Yazid’s grandmother came to be known as “akilatu ’l-akbad – the liver-eater.”",
        "DESC: Second Comment: Lady Zaynab also exposes Yazid’s inner hatred towards the family of the Prophet (the Ahlul Bayt). She informs the people of Sham that the family of Abu Sufyan is not part of the family of the Prophet; on the contrary, their hearts are filled with hatred towards the family of the Prophet, and they don’t hesitate in expressing their rancor. This is so, while all Muslim sects believe that based on the verse of muwaddah (42:23), to love the Prophet’s family is an essential part of Islamic faith.",
        "DESC: 💠 Yazid’s Intentions",
        "With happiness you call out your ancestors:",
        "They would cheer and beam with joy",
        "Saying: O Yazid, may you not be overcome",
        "[You are reciting this] while bending down targeting the teeth of Abu ‘Abdillah [al-Husayn], chief of the youths of Paradise, and poking at them with your cane—your face had lit up with joy.",
        "I swear by my life that by spilling the blood of Muhammad’s children and the star of the family of ‘Abdul Muttalib (i.e., Husayn), you have scratched the [old] wound and revived the [past] animosity.",
        "You are loudly calling out your ancestors, and think that you are actually calling them! [They are dead and they can’t hear you!] Very soon, you will reach their place [in the hell], and at that time you would wish that you had become paralyzed and dumb so that you would have not said what you had said and not done what you had done.",
        "O Allah, take our right [from those who had usurped it], take revenge from those who have oppressed us, and unleash Your wrath on one who has spilled our blood and killed our supporters.",
        "DESC: First Comment: In the midst of the elite of Sham, Lady Zaynab describes the difference between the family of the Prophet and the family of Abu Sufyan: If the blessed head that Yazid is desecrating is that of the chief of the youths of Paradise, then what will be the eventual destination of Yazid? If the one who was killed is the chief of the youths of Paradise, then the killer cannot be from those who will be in Paradise!",
        "DESC: Second Comment: Why was Imam Husayn (a.s.) killed? By repeating the poems recited by Yazid, Zaynab wanted to show that he killed Imam Husayn to avenge the death of his idol- worshipping/infidel ancestors who were killed in the Battle of Badr, the first battle in the history of Muslims.",
        "DESC: In that battle, when the father, the brother and the uncle of Yazid’s grandmother challenged the Muslim fighters to a duel, the Prophet (S) sent some members of his family, the Banu Hashim: Hamzah, ‘Ubaydah and ‘Ali—it was by their swords that the leaders of idol-worshippers were killed.",
        "DESC: By killing Imam Husayn and other members of the Prophet’s family, Yazid was avenging the death of his infidel ancestors.",
        "DESC: Third Comment: O Yazid, you are calling out to your ancestors but soon you will also end up with them, and then you will regret and wish that your tongue had become dumb so that you would have recited the blasphemous poems, and had not got involved in killing Imam Husayn (a.s.)—but alas, regret at that time will be of no use.",
        "DESC: 💠 The End of Yazid",
        "(O Yazid,) you have done what you wanted to do. (By doing what you have done,) you have actually pierced your own skin and have torn your own flesh. You will surely be presented to the Messenger of Allah with your crime of spilling the blood of his descendants and your act of violating the sanctity of his family and relatives. At that time, Allah will unite them, end their separation, avenge those who oppressed them, and take their right from their enemies.",
        "So do not let [your act of] killing them fill your excitement. [Do not you remember what Allah has said:]",
        "And do not consider those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead; rather they are alive with their Lord, being sustained; they are pleased with what Allah has given to them out of His grace. (3:169-170)",
        "It suffices for you to know that (on the day of judgement), Allah will be the Judge, the Messenger of Allah will be plaintiff [against you], and Jibra’il will be the supporter [of the Prophet]. Those who facilitated [the government] for you and imposed you on the necks of the Muslims will soon know how evil shall be the recompense of the transgressors, and who among you will be in the worst place and the most misguided.",
        "DESC: First Comment: Zaynab is reminding Yazid that don’t think by killing my brother and family, you have eliminated them. No, not at all; they are martyrs in the way of Allah – they live not only in the other world, sustained by Almighty’s grace, but they will always live in the hearts of the believers.",
        "DESC: Second Comment: With Allah as the judge, the Prophet as the plaintiff and Jibra’il as the witness what chance has Yazid escaping retribution on the day of judgement?! This is a point on what those Muslims should also reflect who go around preaching that Yazid is among the “forgiven ones”!",
        "DESC: 💠 Challenging Yazid",
        "Plan your stratagem, strive to your maximum, and put your best efforts but, by Allah, neither will you be able to erase our memory [from the people’s minds] nor can you destroy our revelation, nor can you reach our heights, and your shame [for killing Husayn] cannot be washed out.",
        "Your idea is nothing but wrong, your days are numbered, and your gathering will soon disperse - the day when the herald will announce: Verily the curse of Allah is on the oppressors!",
        "DESC: First Comment: Zaynab challenges Yazid on his own turf to do whatever is within his power but he will not be able to erase the religion of her grandfather or the Qur’an which was revealed upon him or the love for his family that is found in hearts of the Muslims.",
        "DESC: Second Comment: Since Zaynab always maintained the zikr and remembrance of Allah even in the most difficult of times (to the extent that in spite of hunger and thirst, and having witnessed the murder of eighteen members of her family in one day, she did not forget her night nafila on the eve of 11th Muharram)—and so Allah has also kept the memory of Zaynab always alive in hearts of the people.",
        "DESC: Even centuries after her passing away, Zaynab’s name is remembered and mentioned all over the world whereas Yazid’s name has become like a swear word. No one knows of Yazid’s grave whereas there are two famous shrines associated to Zaynab: one in Damascus and another in Cairo, and both shrines are filled with visitors and pilgrims whose prayers are answered in those places!",
        "DESC: 💠 Last Sentences of the Sermon",
        "So all praise is due to Allah who granted our ancestors the bliss and our present generation the honor of martyrdom; and we ask Allah to complete their reward and give them even more, and make us their worthy successors. He is indeed Merciful and Loving; Allah is sufficient for us and He is the best supporter.",
        "INFO: The Result of the Sermon",
        "DESC: Finally, the true face of the family of Abu Sufyan was exposed to the people of Sham by this sermon. Let alone the Muslims of Sham, even the Jewish, Christians and foreign representatives stationed in Damascus criticized Yazid for violating the sanctity of the family of his own Prophet by killing its men and imprisoning its women.",
        "DESC: The sermon of Lady Zaynab and the sermon of Imam Zayn Al-Abidin complement one another: Zaynab’s sermon formed the “tabarra” dimension and Imam Zayn Al-Abidin’s sermon formed the “tawalla” dimension: the former exposed the real identity of Abu Sufyan’s family while the latter introduced the real image of the Prophet’s family.",
        "DESC: Both these sermons brought down the “iron curtain” erected by the family of Abu Sufyan around Sham, and the government of Abu Sufyan’s family crumbled in such a way that Yazid’s son, Mu‘awiyah, refused to sit on the throne and the Umayyid government moved to the family of Marwan.",
        "DESC: This was the beginning of the end of the Umayyid power.",
        "DESC: And the wrongdoers will soon know to what destination they will return. (26:227)"
